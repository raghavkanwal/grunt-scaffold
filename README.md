# Hello!

Howdy! 

#### WotDeFOSS is this?

This is a scaffold that I made for future grunt-projects that I'll be doing. 

Grunt is installed on a 'per-project' basis, therefore it can lead to some startup tweaking.

I'm making this so that I can minimize the time it takes to start a new project with Grunt.

#### What does this package include?

Currently I've added 3 plugins, namely "grunt-contrib-connect", "grunt-contrib-sass" and "grunt-contrib-watch".
These 3 plugins are what are essential for all projects that start out. I'll be adding more to this as needed. 

#### Can I use this for myself?

Ofcourse! Just clone/fork this repo and you're good to go! :D
